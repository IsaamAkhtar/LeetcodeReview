Balanced strings are those that have an equal quantity of 'L' and 'R' characters.

Given a balanced string s, split it into some number of substrings such that:

Each substring is balanced.
Return the maximum number of balanced strings you can obtain.


Example 1:
Input: s = "RLRRLLRLRL"
Output: 4
Explanation: s can be split into "RL", "RRLL", "RL", "RL", each substring contains same number of 'L' and 'R'.

count = 0
result = 0
for ch in s:
            if ch == 'L':
                count += 1
            else:
                count -= 1
            if count == 0:
                result += 1
        return result
