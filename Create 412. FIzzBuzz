Given an integer n, return a string array answer (1-indexed) where:

answer[i] == "FizzBuzz" if i is divisible by 3 and 5.
answer[i] == "Fizz" if i is divisible by 3.
answer[i] == "Buzz" if i is divisible by 5.
answer[i] == i (as a string) if none of the above conditions are true.
 

    def fizzBuzz(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: List[str]
        """
        intAnswer = list(range(1, n + 1))
        for i in range(len(intAnswer)):
            if (intAnswer[i] % 3) == 0 and (intAnswer[i] % 5) == 0:
                intAnswer[i] = "FizzBuzz"
            elif (intAnswer[i] % 3) == 0:
                intAnswer[i] = "Fizz"
            elif (intAnswer[i] % 5) == 0:
                intAnswer[i] = "Buzz"
        answer = [str(num) for num in intAnswer]
        return answer
