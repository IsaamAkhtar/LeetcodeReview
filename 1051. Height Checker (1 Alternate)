A school is trying to take an annual photo of all the students. The students are asked to stand in a single file line in non-decreasing order by height.
Let this ordering be represented by the integer array expected where expected[i] is the expected height of the ith student in line.

You are given an integer array heights representing the current order that the students are standing in. Each heights[i] is the height of the ith student in line (0-indexed).

Return the number of indices where heights[i] != expected[i].


    def heightChecker(self, heights):
        differences = 0
        sortedHeights = sorted(heights)
        for i in range(len(heights)):
            if heights[i] != sortedHeights[i]:
                differences += 1
        return differences

Alternate Solution:

def heightChecker(self, heights: List[int]) -> int:
        expected = sorted(heights)
        return sum(1 for i, height in enumerate(heights) if height != expected[i])
