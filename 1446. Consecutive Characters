The power of the string is the maximum length of a non-empty substring that contains only one unique character.

Given a string s, return the power of s.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "leetcode"
Output: 2
Explanation: The substring "ee" is of length 2 with the character 'e' only.
Example 2:

Input: s = "abbcccddddeeeeedcba"
Output: 5
Explanation: The substring "eeeee" is of length 5 with the character 'e' only.

def maxPower(self, s: str) -> int:
        currentPower = 1
        maxPower = 1

        for i in range(1, len(s)):
            if s[i] == s[i -1]:
                currentPower += 1
            else:
                maxPower = max(currentPower, maxPower)
                currentPower = 1
        maxPower = max(maxPower, currentPower)
        return maxPower
