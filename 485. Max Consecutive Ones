Given a binary array nums, return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array.

 

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,1,0,1,1,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: The first two digits or the last three digits are consecutive 1s. The maximum number of consecutive 1s is 3.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,0,1,1,0,1]
Output: 2

    def findMaxConsecutiveOnes(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        maxConsecutiveOnes = 0
        currentConsecutiveOnes = 0
        for num in nums:
            if num == 1:
                currentConsecutiveOnes += 1
                maxConsecutiveOnes = max(maxConsecutiveOnes, currentConsecutiveOnes)
            else:
                currentConsecutiveOnes = 0

        return maxConsecutiveOnes
