Given an integer array sorted in non-decreasing order, there is exactly one integer in the array that occurs more than 25% of the time, return that integer.

mySet = set(arr)
noOfOcurrences = 0
for i in mySet:
    count = arr.count(i)
    noOfOccurrences.append(count)
maxO = max(noOfOccurrences)
for i in arr:
    if arr.count(i) == maxO
    return i
